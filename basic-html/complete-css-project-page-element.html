                <b>Introduction!</b> <br /> Before understanding Neuroplasticity, it is necessary to understand the term;
                 'plasticity'. 'Plasticity is the ability of any structure weak enough to change by an external stimulus,
                  however strong enough not to mould at a once. In addition, the nervous tissue in the human brain is
                   allocated with a tremendous capacity of plasticity
                    Neuroplasticity or brain plasticity is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its 
                    activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or 
                    connections. A fundamental property of neurons is their ability to modify the strength and efficacy of 
                    synaptic transmission through a diverse number of activity-dependent mechanisms, typically referred to 
                    as synaptic plasticity.

                    membrane, there occurs a release of a small amount of glutamate. Furthermore, this glutamate 
                    binds to receptors present over the membrane. This leads to stimulation of AMPA 
                    (alpha amino-3-hydroxy-5-mether 4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors that allows influx of 
                    sodium (Na+) into the post-synaptic membrane. In addition, magnesium ions are released which 
                    subsequently blocks NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptors. Overall, this process leads to further 
                    release of glutamate over the pos-synaptic membrane. Therefore, more sodium ions enter into the 
                    post-synaptic membrane increasing the positive charge. Furthermore, this event leads to expelling 
                    of magnesium ions from the NMDA receptors, which allows more calcium influx into the post-synaptic 
                    cells. All this leads to activation of ‘Protein Kinase C and Calmodulin Kinase’, which causes the 
                    addition of more AMPA receptors over the pos-synaptic membrane. This leads to further stimulation 
                    of post-synaptic membrane to release more glutamate which enhances ‘strengthening of the synapse and 
                    thus potentiation has occurred’
