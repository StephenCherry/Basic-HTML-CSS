            You are developing a business-critical enterprise application. 
            You need to deliver changes rapidly, frequently and reliably - as measured by the DORA metrics - 
            in order for your business to thrive in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world. 
            Consequently, your engineering organization is organized into small, loosely coupled, cross-functional teams.
             Each team delivers software using DevOps practices as defined by the DevOps handbook. 
             
             In particular, it practices continuous deployment. The team delivers a stream of small, frequent changes that
              are tested by an automated deployment pipeline and deployed into production.
