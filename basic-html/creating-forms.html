<!-- This is about defining a basic user interface of creating form and taking user's input. The "br" tag at the end of
almost every line is just to create a simple line to differentiate each line. Note that the ACTION attribute in form is
empty. I will talk about it in the next section. Form has 2 methods which are POST AND GET methods.

PLACEHOLDER is used to instruct the users what to do

HTML Form Elements Documentation

This simple HTML snippet demonstrates the usage of various form input elements to collect user information. 
Forms are a fundamental part of web development, allowing users to input data that can be submitted to a server for processing. 
Below is a breakdown of each element and its purpose:

<!DOCTYPE HTML>: This declaration specifies that the HTML document follows HTML standard.

<html>: The opening tag of the HTML document.

<body>: The opening tag for the main content of the HTML page.

<form action=" " method="post">: This tag defines a form that will gather user input. 
The ACTION attribute specifies the URL where the form data will be sent but since i am not connected to the backend API
that is why it is empty here. METHOD attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used (in this case, POST).

The placeholder attribute provides a hint for the expected input.

A date picker input, allowing the user to select a date. A time picker input, allowing the user to select a time.

REST: A button that resets all the form inputs to their default values.

SUBMIT: A button to submit the form data to the server for processing. -->
